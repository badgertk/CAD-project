*** NOTE: Stimulus name mapped table won't be printed to file
"testfixture.verilog". If you
    want to have them printed, please set
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t
    in CIW before invoking the
verilog netlister.
*** NOTE: CDBA internal net name will be printed to those floating instance
ports.
    If you don't want have them printed,
    please set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t in CIW or .simrc.
*** NOTE: All cellviews in the design will be in Netlist Configuration list.
  
 If you only want those cellviews that need to be re-netlisted in the list,
   
please set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t in CIW or .simrc.
*** Warning! The module ports will be printed without the port ranges. If you
 
  have split buses across module ports you may get an incorrect netlist. To get

   module ports with port ranges please set simVerilogDropPortRange = nil in CIW
or .simrc.

*** NOTE: All initial state of stimulus of inout  pins are set to "z". To get
inout pins
    with initial state of "0", please set hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr
= "0" in CIW or simrc.


*** The netlisting will be done using connection by order
*** ( Implicit
connections)  for all the stopping cells

***  Library - NCSU_Analog_Parts, Cell - nmos, View - functional

*** Module port ordering for lib NCSU_Analog_Parts, cell nmos, view functional
will be
*** done using the user specified port order as follows:
 => ("D" "S"
"G")

***  Library - NCSU_Analog_Parts, Cell - pmos, View - functional

*** Module port ordering for lib NCSU_Analog_Parts, cell pmos, view functional
will be
*** done using the user specified port order as follows:
 => ("D" "S"
"G")
